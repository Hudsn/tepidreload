# tepidreload

## Not-so-hot browser reloading

Monitors the target directory for changes and reloads the browser on change. 

Very scuffed and probably not stable, but seems to generally get the job done for my small use cases.

Compile to bin with `make build` and use for basic static site dev stuff. Should output to a `build` directory.

Or import it into a Go project to use for a dev environment. Check out the `examples` folder for a general idea of usage in a Go project.
