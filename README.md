# tepidreload

## Not-so-hot browser reloading

Very scuffed and probably not stable, but seems to generally get the job done.

### Monitors the target directory for changes and reloads the browser on change. 

Compile to bin with `make build` and use for basic static site dev stuff. Should output to a `build` directory.

or import it into a go project to use for a dev environment (check out `examples` folder) for a general idea of usage.
